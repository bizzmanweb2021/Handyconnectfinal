                         <p>I have a small bathroom and desperate for more storage space!! Any ideas?</p>

                         <p>Bathrooms are usually one of the smallest rooms in a house. Do you feel cramped, tight within
                            the bathroom in order for you to get ready for school or work every day? At HandyConnect,
                            we have seen many different sizes of bathroosm. Let us help you to maximize the space with
                            great storage ideas!</p>
                            <p>Home repairs that offer additional storage:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Install new shelves on empty walls on the walls or over the toilet.</li>
                                <li>Replace the mirror with one that has a cabinet for extra storage space.
                                </li>
                                <li>Install towel racks inside the shower area.</li>
                                <li>Add decorative hooks at the back of the bathroom door for robes and towels.
                                </li>
                                <li>Get a vanity cabinet instead of a pedestal one as it creates extra storage and
                                    better aesthetic look to the entire bathroom.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Other ways to organize your bathroom for that needed storage space:</p>
                            <p>Only keep your daily necessities in the bathroom. Store your overflow or special occasion
                                toiletries separately in bedroom closets where you have more room. This allows you to bring
                                them into your bathroom when needed but needs the non-essentials out of the way of your
                                everyday life.</p>
                                <p>Do not over-stock up items that take up more storage space.</p>
                                <p>Maximize your shelf space by purchasing decorative baskets to keep your toiletries organized.</p>
                                <p>HandyConnect can help you refurbish your bathroom with both minor and major handyman

                            <br>
                           <p>Typically, grab bars are installed in the shower areas or near the toilet seating areas. They
                            are simple devices that make a difference to ensure safety of the elderly or handicapped. They
                            help to stabilize as they maneuver and offer a good handhold for a moment of rest. Grab bars
                            require proper installation so they can safely bear the weight of the person holding onto them. Finding an expert handyman for the job is thus very important. Consider adding grab bars
                            around the house for better safety precaution to prevent falls</p>
